# 🎵 soundcloud ripper

this tool lets you rip tracks from soundcloud. works on both public and unlisted/private links. i've been working on it for months now.

## 📜 note

yes, this is a burner account. just like my discord account. i don't wanna risk getting banned on my main github/discord accounts.

## 🛠 how it works

not gonna lie, it's not your average open-source script.
this ripper is built to handle **unlisted/private** soundcloud tracks too, not just the public ones.
so yeah, it's a bit more powerful than what you'll find floating around on github.

## 📦 what's in this repo?

nothing here, for now. the actual tool isn't public.
why? because it's not free. and let's be real, you probably know why that makes sense.

## 💬 interested?

if you're serious about getting access, hit me up on discord: **`gr8m00d`**

(you can also ask me any questions before you buy, no worries)

## ⚠️ disclaimer

this tool is for **educational and personal backup purposes only**.
don't do anything shady or illegal with it, that's on you.
